# password-generator
I added some characters and functions to the JavaScript Code.  The characters I added that would make up the password were uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.  
I made sure the password length was no less then 8 characters and no more then 128 characters. I did this by creating the function: for (i=0;i< length;i++) {  
I created a string in this format:
    var char = upperChar + lowerChar + numChars + specialChar:  This format was the string I used to make sure all the characters would appear in the password.
